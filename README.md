# Geometrical Objects Coding Exercise

## About this exercise
The objective of this coding exercise is to evaluate how candidates can translate abstract ideas into code, in this
case, how to represent
[Two Dimensional Geometric Shapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_two-dimensional_geometric_shapes).

The candidate should show proper Object-oriented design and best practices, following well-know standards like
[SOLID principles](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)).

## Rules and Constraints

- Design classes and objects that represent geometrical objects and shapes.
- Constrain your work to basic geometrical objects and two-dimensional shapes,
  three-dimensional objects and shapes are not required for this exercise.
- You should implement at least six different geometrical objects and shapes.
- Objects must contain properties and behaviors.
- You can use the language of your choice, but it must be a language that supports Object-Oriented Design.
- Do not use 3rd party libraries or any other dependency **in your design**, that is, use only the basic modules of your
  language of choice. For instance, if you choose Java, use only classes available at java.lang.* package.
  You can use 3rd party libraries for build, compile, write and run tests.
- Include tests for objects behavior.
- Push your code to your personal Github, Bitbucket or similar solution and send us the link to the repo.
